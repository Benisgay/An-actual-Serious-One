I was inspired to start some js
I added some amazing logos to help the cringe out. As you will see my photos took forever to choose.
I classed it as black so it would be easier to code so dont call me racist.
wasnt too sure where to put my js so i  just put it in my html folder since it aint much. 
i think i uploaded everything correctly but then again I could be wrong.
scroll so navbar looks cool
